Management believes the confidence of\\nwholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with\\nskilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.\\n \\nResearch and Patents\\n \\nResearch and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit\\ngrowth. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.735 billion in 2016, $1.763 billion in 2015 and $1.770 billion in 2014.\\nResearch and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and\\nimproved products and their uses, totaled $1.225 billion in 2016, $1.223 billion in 2015 and $1.193 billion in 2014. Related expenses\\nprimarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and\\nmaintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses\\nassociated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\\n \\nThe Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous\\nU.S. and foreign patents. The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by\\nnew patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent\\ngrant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent,\\nwhich can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in\\nthe country.\\n \\nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or\\ngroup of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments. The importance of\\npatents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in\\nPart II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n \\nRaw Materials\\n \\nIn 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in\\ncrude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories,\\nincluding petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient\\nquantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw\\nmaterials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend\\ncategory price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\\n \\nEnvironmental Law Compliance\\n \\n3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to\\ncontinue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to\\nenvironmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and\\nContingencies).\\n7', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 7, 'end_page': 8}),\n",

This amount excludes expenditures for\\nremediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are\\nexpensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant\\nimprovements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed\\nor upgraded in the normal course of business.

The Company may\\nalso make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to\\nshareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\\n \\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.\\nWords such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,”\\n“forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements.

The Company\\noperates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States.

The Company’s business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary 10\\nTable of Contents \\nconditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity\\nmeasures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in\\nspecific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and\\nsuppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate\\nearnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\\n \\n* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding. The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of\\ncapital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based\\non a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and\\ntimeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit\\nrating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In March 2016, Moody’s downgraded 3M’s rating from Aa3 to A1, revised\\n3M’s outlook from negative to stable, and affirmed the Company’s short-term rating of P-1. This ratings action followed 3M’s\\nannouncement of its new five-year plan for the period 2016 through 2020 in which the Company communicated its intent to further increase\\nfinancial leverage. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The\\nCompany’s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could impact 3M’s credit\\nrating in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could\\nadversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\\n \\n* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s products, which\\nimpacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the\\nCompany’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of\\ninventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in\\nthe Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our\\nproducts, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the\\ndemand for some of the Company’s products.\\n \\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its\\nsales and earnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the\\nCompany’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected\\ngrowth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\\n \\n* The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its\\nability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by\\ndifficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property\\nprotection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\\n \\n* The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials\\nand energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency\\nexchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy\\n(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its\\nsupplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained\\ninterruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the\\nCompany has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able\\nto successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the\\nCompany.\\n \\n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving\\nbusiness strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results.

The 11\\nTable of Contents \\nCompany monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic\\nalliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the\\nCompany’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\\n \\n* The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company\\nutilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined\\nas changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational\\nefficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multiyear phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the\\nprojected productivity improvements will be realized.\\n \\n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP\\nsystem as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security breaches and other disruptions to the\\nCompany’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the\\nCompany and its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s\\nbusiness and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of\\nwhich are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business\\nprocesses and activities. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may\\nhave access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and\\ncustomer-imposed controls. Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and\\nsystems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information\\ntechnology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,\\nemployee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers\\nincluding cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an\\nextended period, up to and including several years. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats\\nto the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company.\\nThere may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis. Any such events\\ncould result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s\\nreputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various\\ncybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\\n \\n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our\\nresults. The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.\\nSignificant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant\\nlegislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely\\nimpact its results of operations and cash flows.\\n \\n* The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those\\ninvolving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,\\nanti-corruption, or other matters.

Operational benefits also included the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, in addition to productivity benefits 17\\nTable of Contents \\nrelated to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These operational benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower\\nasset utilization. Restructuring actions resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year\\nbenefit in 2016.\\n \\nAcquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of\\nMembrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016),\\nthe library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter\\n2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology outlicensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to\\nearnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for\\nfurther discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts.\\n \\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the\\nimpact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016.\\n \\nOver the past few years, 3M has taken actions to better optimize its capital structure and reduce its cost of capital by adding debt. These\\nactions have led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016, largely due to higher average debt balances.\\n \\nThe income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by\\na number of factors as referenced in Note 8, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09\\n(discussed in Note 1).\\n \\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2016 declined 3 percent versus last year, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits\\nfrom share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number\\nof diluted shares in 2016.\\n \\nRefer to the section entitled “Results of Operations” for further discussion.\\n \\nYear 2015 versus Year 2014 EPS:\\n \\nFor total year 2015, net income attributable to 3M was $4.833 billion, or $7.58 per diluted share, compared to $4.956 billion, or $7.49 per\\ndiluted share, in 2014, an increase of 1.2 percent on a per diluted share basis. Operational benefits include the combination of selling price\\nincreases and raw material cost decreases, partially offset by higher pension/postretirement benefit costs. Restructuring actions (discussed in\\nNote 4) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share. Acquisition and divestiture impacts primarily relate to the Capital Safety\\nand Membrana acquisitions, and the divestitures of the license plate converting business in France and substantially all of the library\\nsystems business. Foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings per diluted share by approximately 43 cents year-on-year, driven by\\naverage year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates in the Euro of 17 percent, Yen of 12 percent, and Brazil Real of 30 percent. The\\nincome tax rate was largely unchanged year-on-year. Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in 2015 declined 3.7 percent year-on-year\\nto 637.2 million, which increased earnings per diluted share by approximately 28 cents. Refer to the section entitled “Results of Operations”\\nfor further discussion.\\n \\nFourth-quarter 2016 sales and operating income results: \\n \\nFourth-quarter 2016 net income attributable to 3M was $1.155 billion, or $1.88 per diluted share, compared to $1.038 billion, or $1.66 per\\ndiluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Sales declined slightly in oral care, as this business continued to be impacted by soft end-market\\nconditions and channel inventory adjustments.

Electronics-related sales were flat, with growth in electronics materials\\nsolutions more than offset by a decline in display materials and systems. This was an improvement over recent quarters as endmarket conditions and channel inventories became more stable. Energy-related sales declined 2 percent as growth in\\ntelecommunications markets was offset by declines in electrical markets, and renewable energy.

In February 2016, 3M’s Board of 21\\nTable of Contents \\nDirectors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, which replaced the Company’s February 2014\\nrepurchase program. This new program has no pre-established end date. In 2016, the Company purchased $3.75 billion of its own stock,\\ncompared to purchases of more than $5 billion of its own stock each year in 2015 and 2014. The Company expects to purchase $2.5 billion\\nto $4.5 billion of its own stock in 2017. In February 2017, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2017 dividend of $1.175 per\\nshare, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 59th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. 3M’s debt to total capital ratio (total\\ncapital defined as debt plus equity) was 53 percent at December 31, 2016, 48 percent at December 31, 2015, and 35 percent at December 31,\\n2014. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook,\\nfrom Moody’s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding\\nthroughout business cycles.\\n \\nRaw materials:\\n \\nIn 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in\\ncrude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets. This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories,\\nincluding petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date the Company is receiving sufficient quantities\\nof all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials\\nor the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of\\nexisting raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks\\nthrough negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\\n \\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\\n \\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 84 percent funded at year-end 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension\\nplan, which is approximately 68 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 90 percent funded and the international pension plans\\nwere 85 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2016\\nfor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 5.8%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets\\nto manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for\\n2017 is 7.25%, down 0.25% from 2016. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2016 discount rate was 4.21%, down 0.26\\npercentage points from the year-end 2015 discount rate of 4.47%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of\\nthe projected benefit obligation (PBO). The plan’s funded status decreased slightly in 2016 as the growth in the PBO increased at a greater\\nrate than the plan assets returned in 2016. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided\\nin Note 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\\n \\n3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans\\nin 2017. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2017. 3M expects\\nglobal defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2017 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other)\\nto increase by approximately $74 million pre-tax when compared to 2016. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and\\nNote 11 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.\\n \\nBeginning on January 1, 2016, with respect to defined contribution plans, the Company reduced its match on employee 401(k) contributions\\nfor U.S. employees. Previously, based on the date the employee was hired, up to 6% of eligible compensation was matched in cash at rates\\nof 60%, 75% or 100%.

Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate\\ninvestment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and\\nenvironmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation)\\nthat the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous\\nitems, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\\n \\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $75 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M’s defined benefit pension and\\npostretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. In addition, the\\nportion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.

As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements\\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\\nrelated disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions\\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying\\nvalues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\n \\nThe Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement\\nobligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical\\naccounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.\\n \\nLegal Proceedings:\\n \\nThe categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates\\nof its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings.

Pension and Postretirement Obligations: 3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective 37\\nTable of Contents \\nJanuary 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in\\naccordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit\\nobligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or\\noverfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and\\nrecognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a\\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are\\nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 11 for additional discussion of\\nactuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.\\n \\nPension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at\\nretirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for\\nservices already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting\\nbenefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the\\nyields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\\nprojected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the\\ncalculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the\\nmethod used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new\\nmethod measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation.\\nService costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is\\ndetermined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not\\naffect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses\\nrecorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and\\ninterest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company\\naccounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.\\n \\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\\n \\n \\nU.S. Qualified\\nPension\\n \\nInternational\\nPension\\n(weighted\\naverage)\\n \\nU.S.\\nPostretirement\\nMedical\\n \\nDecember 31, 2016 Liability:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nBenefit obligation\\n \\n4.21 %\\n2.54 %\\n4.08 %\\n2017 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nService cost\\n \\n4.44 %\\n2.32 %\\n4.37 %\\nInterest cost\\n \\n3.62 %\\n2.25 %\\n3.41 %\\n \\nAnother significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan\\nassets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the\\nexpected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2017 is 7.25%, 0.25% lower than 2016. Refer to Note 11 for information on\\nhow the 2016 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are\\ncalculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average\\nexpected return for the international pension plan is 5.16% for 2017, compared to 5.77% for 2016.\\n \\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement\\nexpense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $251 million, down from $556 million in 2015.

This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses.\\nThese estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance,\\nexpected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the\\nrelated asset group.\\n \\nOf the $2.3 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose\\ntradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary\\nvaluation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach.\\nSpecifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate\\nmarket/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to\\nmarket/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset,\\nimpairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2016, no impairment was\\nindicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 10 percent.\\n \\n3M goodwill totaled approximately $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the\\nfourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.\\nReporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have\\nsimilar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for\\nimpairment testing.\\n \\nAn impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair\\nvalue of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a\\nprice/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio\\napproach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash\\nflows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to businesses where the\\nprice/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for\\nbusinesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\\n \\nAs described in Note 16, effective in the first quarter of 2016, 3M made a product line reporting change involving two of its business\\nsegments. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine\\nthe impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any\\npotential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed.

The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2016 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time. 39\\nTable of Contents \\nAs of October 1, 2016, 3M had 26 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill.\\nThese ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and\\nSystems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety (which\\nincludes the Capital Safety acquisition), Separation and Purification (which includes the Membrana acquisition), and Traffic Safety and\\nSecurity. The estimated fair values for these reporting units were in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent or more, except for\\none reporting unit with approximately $250 million of goodwill, where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 30\\npercent. 3M’s market value at both December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016, was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of\\napproximately $10 billion and $12 billion, at December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively.\\n \\nIn 2016, 3M primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting\\nunits, to determine fair values. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using\\nprojected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The\\nweighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.\\n \\n3M is an integrated materials enterprise, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on\\nresearch and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill\\nassociated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2016, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting\\nunits.\\n \\nFactors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in\\ncompetitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in\\nItem 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing\\nresults. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment\\nfor reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a\\ndefinite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset\\ngroup) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived\\nassets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2017 for any triggering events or\\nother indicators of impairment.\\n \\nIncome Taxes:\\n \\nThe extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude\\nof jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions\\nand resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records\\ntax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent\\nto which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in\\nincome taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 8 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing\\nfacts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that\\nis materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be\\nless than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less\\nthan the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company\\ndetermines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\\n \\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEM ENTS\\n \\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n \\n40', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 40, 'end_page': 41}),\n",

The Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016.\\nProspectively beginning January 1, 2016, excess tax benefits/deficiencies have been reflected as income tax benefit/expense in the\\nstatement of income resulting in a $184 million tax benefit for 2016. 3M typically experiences the largest volume of stock option exercises\\nand restricted stock unit vestings in the first quarter of its fiscal year. Refer to Note 1 for additional detail.\\n \\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDI TY\\n \\n3M continues its transition to a better-optimized capital structure and is adding leverage at a measured pace. The strength and stability of\\n3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, enable the Company to implement\\nthis strategy. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and\\ndevelopment, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary\\nacquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in\\nthe United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund\\ndividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. For those\\ninternational earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for\\nU.S. operations. However, if these international funds are needed for operations in the U.S., 3M would be required to accrue and pay U.S.\\ntaxes to repatriate them. See Note 8 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\\n \\n3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have\\ncontinuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion\\noutstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. Effective July 15, 2016, this program was increased to a\\nmaximum of $5 billion outstanding from a previous program size of $3 billion.\\n \\nTotal Debt:\\n \\nThe strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the\\nCompany’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total\\nportfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable\\noutlook from Moody’s Investors Service.\\n \\nThe Company has a “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, effective May 16, 2014, which registers an\\nindeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future sales. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an\\namended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term\\nnotes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal\\namount up to $9 billion of the same Series.\\n \\nThe Company’s total debt was $853 million higher at December 31, 2016 when compared to December 31, 2015, with the increase\\nprimarily due to May 2016 and September 2016 debt issuances, partially offset by the September 2016 repayment of $1 billion aggregate\\nprincipal amount of medium-term notes. In May 2016, 3M issued 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate\\nmedium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate\\nmedium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of fiveyear fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate\\nmedium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate mediumterm notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\\n \\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange\\nrates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Senior management\\nprovides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company’s financial risk policies and objectives,\\nand provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to\\ncontrol and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\\n \\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity\\nprice swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company\\nactively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks\\nand financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\\n \\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\\n \\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may\\ncause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency\\nearnings to the U.S. dollar.

These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of\\nthe occurrence of the forecasted transaction. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, 3M began extending the maximum length of time\\nover which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions from a previous term of 12 months to a\\nlonger term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, 3M\\nenters into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain\\nintercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements and intercompany financing transactions). As\\ncircumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging\\ninstruments to hedge portions of the Company’s net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the\\nCompany’s foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges and those not designated as hedging instruments\\nwere $3.2 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2016.

All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term “3M” or “Company” refers to 3M Company and\\nsubsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\\n \\nBasis of presentation: Certain consolidated balance sheet amounts relative to prior periods have been immaterially revised to correct the\\nCompany’s application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450, Contingencies, with respect to its respirator mask/asbestos\\nliability associated with pending and future claims and related defense costs. This correction reflects the inclusion of all potentially relevant\\nyears rather than a subset of future years when estimating this liability. See Note 14 for further detail. 3M assessed the materiality of this\\ncorrection to prior periods’ financial statements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.\\n(SAB) 99, Materiality, and SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year\\nFinancial Statements, codified in ASC 250, Presentation of Financial Statements. The Company concluded that the correction was not\\nmaterial to prior periods and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required. In accordance with ASC 250, 3M corrected\\nprior periods presented herein by revising the consolidated balance sheet amounts, including associated deferred taxes. Period to period\\nchanges in previous estimates of probable loss were similar to those of the revised amounts. Accordingly, the correction had no impact on\\nconsolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented, as this correction originates in periods prior to those presented in\\nthe annual report.

Assets and\\nliabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and\\nexpense items are translated at month-end exchange rates of each applicable month. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a\\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\\n \\nAlthough local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the United States, under ASC 830, Foreign Currency\\nMatters, the reporting currency of a foreign entity’s parent is assumed to be that entity’s functional currency when the economic\\nenvironment of a foreign entity is highly inflationary—generally when its cumulative inflation is approximately 100 percent or more for the\\nthree years that precede the beginning of a reporting period. 3M has a subsidiary in Venezuela with operating income representing less than\\n1.0 percent of 3M’s consolidated operating income for 2016.

Since January 1, 2010, the financial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiary have been remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent. 60\\nTable of Contents \\nThe Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local\\ncurrency. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. In January 2014, the Venezuelan government\\nannounced that the National Center for Foreign Commerce (CENCOEX), had assumed the role with respect to the continuation of the\\nexisting official exchange rate, significantly expanded the use of a second currency auction exchange mechanism called the Complementary\\nSystem for Foreign Currency Acquirement (or SICAD1), and issued exchange regulations indicating the SICAD1 rate of exchange would\\nbe used for payments related to international investments. In late March 2014, the Venezuelan government launched a third foreign\\nexchange mechanism, SICAD2, which it later replaced with another foreign currency exchange platform in February 2015 called the\\nMarginal System of Foreign Currency (SIMADI). The SIMADI rate was described as being derived from daily private bidders and buyers\\nexchanging offers through authorized agents. This rate was approved and published by the Venezuelan Central Bank. In March 2016, the\\nVenezuelan government effected a replacement of its preferential CENCOEX rate with Tipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), described as\\navailable largely for essential imports; eliminated its SICAD exchange mechanism; and replaced its SIMADI rate with Tipo de Cambio\\nComplementario (DICOM), published by the Venezuelan Central Bank and described as fluctuating in rate based on supply and demand.\\n \\nThe financial statements of 3M’s Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the official CENCOEX (or its predecessor) rate into\\nMarch 2014, the SICAD1 rate beginning in late March 2014, the SICAD2 rate beginning in June 2014, and the DICOM rate (or its SIMADI\\npredecessor) beginning in February 2015. 3M’s uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not\\nlimited to, the exchange rate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay\\ndividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company’s intent and\\nability to use a particular exchange mechanism. Other factors notwithstanding, remeasurement impacts of the changes in use of these\\nexchange rates did not have material impacts on 3M’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\\n \\nThe Company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its Venezuelan subsidiary. Changes in applicable exchange rates or exchange\\nmechanisms may continue in the future. These changes could impact the rate of exchange applicable to remeasure the Company’s net\\nmonetary assets (liabilities) denominated in Venezuelan Bolivars (VEF). As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a balance of net\\nmonetary assets denominated in VEF of less than 1.5 billion VEF and the DIPRO and DICOM exchange rates were approximately 10 VEF\\nand 670 VEF per U.S. dollar, respectively.\\n \\nA need to deconsolidate the Company’s Venezuelan subsidiary’s operations may result from a lack of exchangeability of VEF-denominated\\ncash coupled with an acute degradation in the ability to make key operational decisions due to government regulations in Venezuela. 3M\\nmonitors factors such as its ability to access various exchange mechanisms; the impact of government regulations on the Company’s ability\\nto manage its Venezuelan subsidiary’s capital structure, purchasing, product pricing, and labor relations; and the current political and\\neconomic situation within Venezuela. Based upon such factors as of December 31, 2016, the Company continues to consolidate its\\nVenezuelan subsidiary. As of December 31, 2016, the balance of intercompany receivables due from this subsidiary and its equity balance\\nwere not significant.\\n \\nReclassifications: Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year\\npresentation.\\n \\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires\\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent\\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\\n \\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less\\nwhen acquired.\\n \\nMarketable securities: The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the nature of the securities and\\navailability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the\\nmeasurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the\\nimpairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”.

A temporary impairment 61\\nTable of Contents \\ncharge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity. Such an\\nunrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The\\nfactors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions,\\nand assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.\\n \\nInvestments: Investments primarily include equity method, cost method, and available-for-sale equity investments. Available-for-sale\\ninvestments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a\\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.\\n \\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance\\npolicies, and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the\\nbalance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums\\npaid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in “Purchases of marketable securities and investments”\\nand “Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,” respectively.\\n \\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at\\ncost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives\\nof the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the\\nrange of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the\\nmajority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until\\ndisposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from\\ndisposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be\\nrecognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the\\nasset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over\\nits fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\\n \\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the\\nretirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional\\nasset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using\\nexpected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs\\nare depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $111 million and $102\\nmillion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\\n \\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a\\nbusiness combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested\\nfor impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.\\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level\\nbelow the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic\\ncharacteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss generally would be recognized\\nwhen the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of\\na reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by\\nusing a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a\\nreporting unit is not “more likely than not” less than its carrying amount, which\\n62', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 62, 'end_page': 63}),\n",

Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from one to twenty years on a\\nsystematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the asset’s use. The estimated useful lives vary by category,\\nwith customer related largely between seven to seventeen years, patents largely between five to thirteen years, other technology-based\\nlargely between two to fifteen years, definite lived tradenames largely between three and twenty years, and other intangibles largely\\nbetween two to ten years. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in\\n“Research, development and related expenses.”\\n \\nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\\nasset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated\\nundiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the\\nexcess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\\n \\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for\\nimpairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that\\nthe carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value\\nof the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\\n \\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract\\ntermination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related\\nseverance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in\\nthe quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated\\nactions. Severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination\\ndates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the\\nemployees’ remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end\\nof its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred\\nunder the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company. Asset impairment charges related to intangible assets\\nand property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets’ carrying values over their fair values.\\n \\nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no\\nmaterial concentration of credit risk. Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to\\ncustomers. This condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. The Company records\\nestimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at\\nthe time of the initial sale. These sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. The estimated\\nreductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the\\nvarious markets served. Since the Company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most\\ncommon incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives.

The selling price used for each\\ndeliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or\\nestimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to\\nestablish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue is not recorded\\nuntil the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the\\nfunctionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.\\n \\nFor arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant\\nproduction, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element is recognized when the Company has\\nVSOE of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. When the\\narrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional\\nperformance is generally employed.\\n \\nFor prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence\\nindicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. License fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized\\nuntil the inception of the license term.\\n \\nOn occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3M will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. For these agreements,\\nand depending on the specifics, 3M may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to\\ndate compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.\\n \\nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company\\nmaintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. The allowance for doubtful accounts and\\nproduct returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales\\nreturns. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and\\nhistorical sales returns. The Company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. The Company does not have any significant\\noff-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\\n \\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $385 million in 2016, $368 million\\nin 2015 and $407 million in 2014.\\n \\nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line\\nof the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.735 billion in 2016, $1.763 billion in 2015\\nand $1.770 billion in 2014. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific\\nadvances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.225 billion in 2016, $1.223 billion in 2015 and $1.193\\nbillion in 2014. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees\\nincurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research\\nand development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method\\neffects and impairments.\\n \\nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of internal-use software.

Under this approach, deferred income\\ntaxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and\\nliabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists.\\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had valuation allowances of $47 million and $31 million on its deferred tax assets,\\nrespectively.

The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged\\nderivatives.\\n \\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps,\\ncommodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The\\nCompany actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major\\ninternational banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when\\npossible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts\\nowed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate\\nnonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the\\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and\\nmay otherwise qualify for net presentation.\\n \\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are\\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount\\nthat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the\\nmeasurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable\\ninputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs\\nare inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent\\nof the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in\\nvaluing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into\\nthree levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted\\nprices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not\\nactive, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are\\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is\\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\\n \\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. This standard requires\\nthe acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and\\nestablishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\\ncombination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of\\nconsideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related\\nrestructuring costs from acquisition accounting.\\n \\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\\n \\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and in\\nAugust 2015 issued ASU No. 2015-14, which amended the standard as to effective date. The ASU provides a single comprehensive model\\nto be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance,\\nincluding industry-specific guidance. The standard’s stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of\\npromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange\\nfor those goods or services. To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the\\ncontract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price,\\n66', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 66, 'end_page': 67}),\n",

To achieve this core principle the ASU includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, 66\\nTable of Contents \\nallocating the transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when (or as) an entity satisfies a performance\\nobligation. The standard also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded\\ndisclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. During 2016,\\nthe FASB also issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net); ASU No. 2016-10,\\nIdentifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU\\nNo. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which amend ASU No.\\n2014-09. These amendments include clarification of principal versus agent guidance in situations in which a revenue transaction involves a\\nthird party in providing goods or services to a customer. In such circumstances, an entity must determine whether the nature of its promise\\nto the customer is to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the principal in the transaction) or to arrange for the third\\nparty to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the agent in the transaction). The amendments clarify, in terms of\\nidentifying performance obligations, how entities would determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable from\\nother promises in a contract and, therefore, would be accounted for separately. The guidance allows entities to disregard goods or services\\nthat are immaterial in the context of a contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling activities as\\nfulfillment costs rather than as additional promised services. With regard to the licensing, the amendments clarify how an entity would\\nevaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which determines whether the entity recognizes revenue over\\ntime or at a point in time. The amendments also address implementation issues relative to transition (adding a practical expedient for\\ncontract modifications and clarifying what constitutes a completed contract when employing full or modified retrospective transition\\nmethods), collectability, noncash consideration, and the presentation of sales and other similar-type taxes (allowing entities to exclude salestype taxes collected from transaction price). Finally, the amendments make certain technical corrections and provide additional guidance in\\nthe areas of disclosure of performance obligations, provisions for losses on certain types of contracts, scoping, and other areas. Overall, ASU\\nNo. 2014-09, as amended, provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified retrospective adoption by which it is applied only to\\nthe most current period presented. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2018. The Company is continuing to evaluate the standard’s\\nimpact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 3M has conducted initial analyses, developed project\\nmanagement relative to the process of adopting this ASU, and is currently completing detailed contract reviews to determine necessary\\nadjustments to existing accounting policies and to support an evaluation of the standard’s impact on the Company’s consolidated results of\\noperations and financial condition. For the majority of 3M’s revenue arrangements, no significant impacts are expected as these transactions\\nare not accounted for under industry-specific guidance that will be superseded by the ASU and generally consist of a single performance\\nobligation to transfer promised goods or services. However, in addition to expanded disclosures regarding revenue, the ASU could, for\\nexample, impact the timing of revenue recognition in some arrangements for which software industry-specific guidance (which the ASU\\nsupersedes) is presently utilized. The Company currently anticipates utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption on January 1,\\n2018.\\n \\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes guidance related to both\\nthe variable interest entity (VIE) and voting interest entity (VOE) consolidation models. With respect to the VIE model, the standard\\nchanges, among other things, the identification of variable interests associated with fees paid to a decision maker or service provider, the\\nVIE characteristics for a limited partner or similar entity, and the primary beneficiary determination. With respect to the VOE model, the\\nASU eliminates the presumption that a general partner controls a limited partnership or similar entity unless the presumption can otherwise\\nbe overcome. Under the new guidance, a general partner would largely not consolidate a partnership or similar entity under the VOE model.\\nThe Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. Because 3M did not have significant involvement with entities subject to\\nconsolidation considerations impacted by the VIE model changes or with limited partnerships potentially impacted by the VOE model\\nchanges, the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Arrangement, which requires a\\ncustomer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license.

The adoption did not have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\n \\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing requirements\\nregarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market. Under existing standards, the market amount requires consideration of\\nreplacement cost, net realizable value (NRV), and NRV less an approximately normal profit margin. The new ASU replaces market with\\nNRV, defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and\\ntransportation. This eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or NRV less an approximately normal profit margin\\nwhen measuring inventory. For 3M, this standard is effective prospectively beginning January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect this\\nASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which\\nrevises the accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain\\nfair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the\\nfair value of financial instruments. The new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other\\nownership interests in an entity, including investments in partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies\\n(collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to\\nmeasure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding\\ngains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available for sale in other comprehensive income (OCI). They\\nalso will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values.\\nInstead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will be\\npermitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in\\norderly transactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair\\nvalue changes of financial liabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be\\nrequired to separately present in OCI the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to\\nreflecting the entire amount in earnings. For derivative liabilities for which the FVO has been elected, however, any changes in fair value\\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk would continue to be presented in net income, which is consistent with current guidance. For\\n3M, this standard is effective beginning January 1, 2018 via a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for\\nguidance relative to equity securities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively. The Company is currently\\nassessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, replacing existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard introduces a\\nlessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income\\nstatements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However,\\nit modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles\\nwith those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining\\nwhen profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and\\nquantitative disclosures. The standard requires modified retrospective transition by which it is applied at the beginning of the earliest\\ncomparative period presented in the year of adoption. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019.

With respect to income taxes, under current guidance, when a sharebased payment award such as a stock option or restricted stock unit (RSU) is granted to an employee, the fair value of the award is generally\\nrecognized over the vesting period. However, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the award’s intrinsic value at the time of\\nexercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax\\nbenefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the compensation cost recognized in the financial statements. Excess tax benefits are\\nrecognized in additional paid-in capital (APIC) within equity, and tax deficiencies are similarly recognized in APIC to the extent there is a\\nsufficient APIC amount (APIC pool) related to previously recognized excess tax benefits. Under the new guidance, all excess tax\\nbenefits/deficiencies would be recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income. The new ASU’s income tax aspects\\nalso impact the calculation of diluted earnings per share by excluding excess tax benefits/deficiencies from the calculation of assumed\\nproceeds available to repurchase shares under the treasury stock method. Relative to forfeitures, the new standard allows an entity-wide\\naccounting policy election either to continue to estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited or to account for forfeitures as they\\noccur. The new guidance also impacts classifications within the statement of cash flows by no longer requiring inclusion of excess tax\\nbenefits as both a hypothetical cash outflow within cash flows from operating activities and hypothetical cash inflow within cash flows from\\nfinancing activities. Instead, excess tax benefits would be classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to\\nincome taxes. Additionally, the new ASU requires cash payments to tax authorities when an employer uses a net-settlement feature to\\nwithhold shares to meet statutory tax withholding provisions to be presented as financing activity (eliminating previous diversity in\\npractice). For 3M, this standard is required effective January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted ASU No.\\n2016-09 as of January 1, 2016. Prospectively beginning January 1, 2016, excess tax benefits/deficiencies have been reflected as income tax\\nbenefit/expense in the statement of income resulting in a $184 million tax benefit in 2016. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is\\nsubject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises. 3M’s adoption of this ASU\\nalso resulted in associated excess tax benefits being classified as operating activity in the same manner as other cash flows related to income\\ntaxes in the statement of cash flows prospectively beginning January 1, 2016. Based on the adoption methodology applied, the statement of\\ncash flows classification of prior periods has not changed. In addition, 3M did not change its accounting principles relative to elements of\\nthis standard and continued its existing practice of estimating the number of awards that will be forfeited.\\n \\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which revises guidance for the\\naccounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope. The new standard introduces an approach, based on expected losses, to\\nestimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments and modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. The\\nnew approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured\\nat amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net\\ninvestments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures.

The new approach to estimating credit losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model) applies to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures. With respect to available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, the ASU 69\\nTable of Contents \\namends the current other-than-temporary impairment model. For such securities with unrealized losses, entities will still consider if a portion\\nof any impairment is related only to credit losses and therefore recognized as a reduction in income. However, rather than also reflecting\\nthat credit loss amount as a permanent reduction in cost (amortized cost) basis of that AFS debt security, the ASU requires that credit losses\\nbe reflected as an allowance. As a result, under certain circumstances, a recovery in value could result in previous allowances, or portions\\nthereof, reversing back into income. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to\\napply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in\\nwhich the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently assessing this ASU’s impact on 3M’s consolidated result of operations and\\nfinancial condition.\\n \\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to\\nreduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The\\nstandard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, contingent consideration\\npayments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and distributions received from equity\\nmethod investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of\\ncash flows. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard requires application using a\\nretrospective transition method. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which modifies existing\\nguidance and is intended to reduce diversity in practice with respect to the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity\\ntransfers of assets. The ASU indicates that the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax\\neffects of certain intercompany transactions would apply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no\\nlonger apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g., intangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense\\nassociated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is eliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and\\nrecorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated group. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from\\nrecognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer. For 3M, this ASU is effective January\\n1, 2018, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2017. The standard requires modified retrospective transition with a cumulative\\ncatch-up adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Upon adoption, a company would write off any income tax\\neffects that had been deferred from past intercompany transactions involving non-inventory assets to opening retained earnings. In addition,\\nan entity would record deferred tax assets with an offset to opening retained earnings for amounts that entity had previously not recognized\\nunder existing guidance but would recognize under the new guidance. While 3M could initiate additional relevant transactions prior to this\\nASU’s adoption date, based on deferred tax amounts related to applicable past intercompany transactions as of December 31, 2016, the\\nCompany does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control, which\\nmodifies existing guidance with respect to how a decision maker that holds an indirect interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) through a\\ncommon control party determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE as part of the analysis of whether the VIE would need to\\nbe consolidated. Under the ASU, a decision maker would need to consider only its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE held through a\\ncommon control party. Previous guidance had required the decision maker to treat the common control party’s interest in the VIE as if the\\ndecision maker held the interest itself. As a result of the ASU, in certain cases, previous consolidation conclusions may change. For 3M, the\\nstandard is effective January 1, 2017 with retrospective application to January 1, 2016. 3M does not have significant involvement with\\nentities subject to consolidation considerations impacted by VIE model factors. As a result, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material\\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Restricted Cash, which clarifies guidance on the classification and presentation of\\nrestricted cash in the statement of cash flows.

The ASU requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single\\nidentifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a\\nbusiness. To be considered a business, the set would need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute\\nto the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of outputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting\\nsuch as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets are expected to be considered businesses. For\\n3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis with early adoption permitted. 3M would apply this guidance to applicable\\ntransactions after the adoption date.\\n \\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under the new standard, goodwill\\nimpairment would be measured as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying\\nvalue of goodwill. This ASU eliminates existing guidance that requires an entity to determine goodwill impairment by calculating the\\nimplied fair value of goodwill by hypothetically assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that\\nreporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. For 3M, this ASU is effective prospectively to impairment tests beginning\\nJanuary 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. 3M would apply this guidance to applicable impairment tests after the adoption date.\\n \\n NOTE 2.

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for items such\\nas Federal, State, and non-U.S. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other\\nAssets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the\\nconsolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $10 million of expense, $2 million of expense, and $14 million of benefit\\nin 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or\\nremeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, accrued interest and penalties in the\\nconsolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $52 million and $45 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts\\nare interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about\\nthe timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the\\nshorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to\\nan earlier period.\\n \\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain manufacturing activities in the\\nfollowing countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2016),\\nThailand (2018), Korea (2019), Brazil (2023), Switzerland (2024), and Singapore (2025).

Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest\\nRatio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated\\ntotal EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period.

For the\\nperiods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\\n \\n NOTE 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\\n \\n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In\\ntotal, 3M has over 80 defined benefit plans in 27 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each\\nparticipant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed\\nto new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for\\nits U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1,\\n2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided\\npostretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\\n \\nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies\\nare maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due\\nto its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to\\nannual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\\n \\n3M’s primary U.S. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the Company has a significant credit\\nbalance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any Pension Protection Act funding requirements.\\n \\nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to\\nsubstantially all regular U.S. employees. Beginning on January 1, 2016, for U.S. employees, the Company reduced its match on employee\\n401(k) contributions. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% (down from 6%\\nprior to 2016) of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates.\\nEmployees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% (down from 6%\\nprior to 2016) of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participant’s\\ntotal eligible compensation.

Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $139 million, $165 million and $153 million for 2016, 2015\\nand 2014, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer\\ncontributions to the international defined contribution plans were $87 million, $77 million and $75 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014,\\nrespectively.\\n \\nAs a result of changes made to its U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans in 2010, the Company has transitioned all current and future\\nretirees to a savings account benefits-based plan. These changes became effective beginning January 1, 2013, for all Medicare eligible\\nretirees and their Medicare eligible dependents and became effective beginning January 1, 2016, for all non-Medicare eligible retirees and\\ntheir eligible dependents. In August 2015, 3M modified the 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan postretirement medical benefit reducing the\\nfuture benefit for participants not retired as of January 1, 2016. For participants retiring after January 1, 2016, the Retiree Medical Savings\\nAccount (RMSA) is no longer credited with interest and the indexation on both the RMSA and the Medicare Health Reimbursement\\nArrangement is reduced from 3 percent to 1.5 percent per year (for those employees who are eligible for these accounts). Also effective\\nJanuary 1, 2016, 3M no longer offers 3M Retiree Health Care Accounts to new hires. Due to these changes the plan was re-measured in the\\nthird quarter of 2015, resulting in a decrease to the projected benefit obligation liability of approximately $233 million, and a related\\nincrease to shareholders’ equity, specifically accumulated other comprehensive income.\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company converted to the “RP 2014 Mortality Tables” and updated the mortality improvement scale it used\\nfor calculating the year-end 2014 U.S. defined benefit pension annuitant and postretirement obligations and 2015 expense. The impact of\\nthis change increased the year-end 2014 U.S. pension projected benefit obligation (PBO) by approximately $820 million and the U.S.\\naccumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $100 million. As of December 31, 2016, the Company updated the\\nmortality improvement scale to Scale MP-2016, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2016. The impact of this change\\ndecreased the year-end 2016 U.S. pension PBO by approximately $440 million and the U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation\\nby approximately $60 million.\\n \\nIn March 2015, 3M Japan modified the Japan Limited Defined Benefit Corporate Pension Plan (DBCPP). Beginning July 1, 2015, eligible\\nemployees receive a company provided contribution match of 6.12% of their eligible salary to their defined contribution plan. Employees no\\nlonger earn additional service towards their defined benefit pension plans after July 1, 2015, except for eligible salaries above the statutory\\ndefined contribution limits. As a result of this plan modification, the Company re-measured the DBCPP, which resulted in a $17 million\\npre-tax curtailment gain for the year ended December 31, 2015. In March 2015, 3M also received a favorable Internal Revenue Service tax\\ndetermination letter to terminate a frozen defined benefit pension plan of one of 3M’s acquired subsidiaries. By the end of 2015, this plan\\nmade final distributions of $16 million to participants. The Company also had other settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits\\nand other items in 2015 aggregating to the amounts indicated in these components in the applicable tables that follow.\\n \\n3M was informed during the first quarter of 2009, that the general partners of WG Trading Company, in which 3M’s benefit plans hold\\nlimited partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the SEC and CFTC (Commodity\\nFutures Trading Commission). In March 2011, over the objections of 3M and six other limited partners of WG Trading Company, the\\ndistrict court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receiver’s proposed distribution plan (and in April 2013, the United States Court of\\nAppeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling). The benefit plan trustee holdings of WG Trading Company interests\\nwere adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement\\ndates. The Company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently known, will result in the probable recovery of a portion of the\\ndecrease in original asset value. In the first quarter of 2014, 3M and certain 3M benefit plans filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the\\nDistrict of Minnesota against five insurers seeking insurance coverage for the WG Trading Company claim. In September 2015, the court\\nruled in favor of the defendant insurance companies on a motion for summary judgment and dismissed the lawsuit. In October 2015, 3M and\\nthe 3M benefit plans filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. As of the 2016 measurement date,\\nthese holdings represented less than one half of one percent of 3M’s fair value of total plan assets. 3M currently believes that the resolution\\nof these events will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.\\n \\n90', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 90, 'end_page': 91}),\n",

The\\ncontributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to\\nJanuary 1, 2016 and increase 1.5 percent for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has\\nmaterial exposure to health care cost inflation.\\n \\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and\\npostretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the\\ncurrent rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the\\nyield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle\\nprojected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 4.21% for pension and 4.26% for\\npostretirement benefits to be appropriate for its U.S. plans as of December 31, 2016, which is a decrease of 0.26 percentage points and 0.22\\npercentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2015. For the international pension and postretirement plans the\\ndiscount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country\\nhas a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that\\ngenerate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. In countries that do not have a deep\\nmarket in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields. \\n \\nBeginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other\\npostretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied\\nto each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows.\\nThe interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot\\nyield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the\\nactuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise\\nmeasure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve\\nrates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016. As a result of the\\nchange to the spot yield curve approach, 2016 annual defined benefit pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost decreased\\napproximately $180 million.\\n \\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.50% in 2016. Projected\\nreturns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and\\ninvestment management. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s 2017 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.25%, a\\ndecrease of 0.25 percentage points from 2016.

The 2016 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of\\n25% global equities, 18% private equities, 41% fixed-income securities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional\\nperformance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in\\n2016 was 5.8%. In 2015 the plan earned a rate of return of 0.7% and in 2014 earned a return of 13.0%. The average annual actual return on\\nthe plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 7.2% and 9.2%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension\\nand other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of\\nreturn assumptions.\\n \\nDuring 2016, the Company contributed $380 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans.\\nDuring 2015, the Company contributed $264 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In\\n2017, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $300 million to $500 million of cash to its U.S. and international\\nretirement plans.

The primary goal of the\\ntrust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its\\nprimary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present\\nand future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the\\npotential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments\\nto offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\\n \\nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds.\\nHowever, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities.

The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and\\nilliquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long\\nperiods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for\\ntactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable\\nranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately 42% of the postretirement benefit plan\\nassets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same\\ninvestment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.\\n \\nThe fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:\\n \\n \\n \\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as\\n \\nFair Value at\\n \\n(Millions)\\n \\nLevel 1\\n \\nLevel 2\\n \\nLevel 3\\n \\nDec. 31,\\n \\nAsset Class\\n 2016\\n 2015\\n 2016\\n 2015\\n 2016\\n 2015\\n \\n2016\\n \\n2015\\n \\nEquities\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nU.S. equities\\n $ 1,522 $ 1,897 $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $ 1,522 $ 1,897 \\nNon-U.S. equities\\n \\n 1,179 1,149 \\n \\n — \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n1,179 \\n1,149 \\nIndex and long/short equity funds*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n414 \\n578 \\nTotal Equities\\n $ 2,701 $ 3,046 $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $ 3,115 $ 3,624 \\nFixed Income\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nU.S. government securities\\n $ 1,701 $ 1,095 $\\n560 $\\n456 $\\n — $\\n — $ 2,261 $ 1,551 \\nNon-U.S. government securities\\n \\n \\n — \\n — \\n \\n146 \\n126 \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n146 \\n126 \\nPreferred and convertible securities\\n \\n \\n4 \\n4 \\n \\n1 \\n8 \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n5 \\n12 \\nU.S. corporate bonds\\n \\n \\n10 \\n9 \\n 3,392 2,820 \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n3,402 \\n2,829 \\nNon-U.S. corporate bonds\\n \\n \\n — \\n — \\n \\n672 \\n616 \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n672 \\n616 \\nDerivative instruments\\n \\n \\n(1) \\n(1) \\n \\n(31) \\n40 \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n(32) \\n39 \\nOther*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n11 \\nTotal Fixed Income\\n $ 1,714 $ 1,107 $ 4,740 $ 4,066 $\\n — $\\n — $ 6,461 $ 5,184 \\nPrivate Equity\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDerivative instruments\\n $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $\\n — $\\n(83) $\\n(106) $\\n(83) $\\n(106) \\nGrowth equity\\n \\n \\n19 \\n24 \\n \\n — \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n — \\n \\n19 \\n24 \\nPartnership investments*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2,188 \\n2,450 \\nTotal Private Equity\\n $\\n19 $\\n24 $\\n — $\\n — $\\n(83) $\\n(106) $ 2,124 $ 2,368 \\nAbsolute Return\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDerivative instruments\\n $\\n — $\\n — $\\n(7) $\\n(5) $\\n — $\\n — $\\n(7) $\\n(5) \\nFixed income and other\\n \\n29 \\n253 \\n78 \\n46 \\n — \\n — \\n107 \\n299 \\nHedge fund/fund of funds*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1,793 \\n1,409 \\nPartnership investments*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n296 \\n355 \\nTotal Absolute Return\\n $\\n29 $\\n253 $\\n71 $\\n41 $\\n — $\\n — $ 2,189 $ 2,058 \\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCash and cash equivalents\\n $\\n55 $\\n102 $\\n — $\\n1 $\\n2 $\\n — $\\n57 $\\n103 \\nRepurchase agreements and derivative margin activity\\n \\n — \\n — \\n(545) \\n5 \\n — \\n — \\n(545) \\n5 \\nCash and cash equivalents, valued at net asset value*\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n931 \\n783 \\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents\\n $\\n55 $\\n102 $\\n(545) $\\n6 $\\n2 $\\n — $\\n443 $\\n891 \\nTotal\\n $ 4,518 $ 4,532 $ 4,266 $ 4,113 $\\n(81) $\\n(106) $ 14,332 $14,125 \\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $\\n(251) $\\n(159) \\nFair value of plan assets\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n $ 14,081 $13,966 \\n \\n* In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its\\nequivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded\\nfrom the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\\n \\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option\\ncontracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are\\ndesignated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may dedesignate these cash flow\\nhedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument\\npreviously accumulated in other comprehensive income for dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until\\nthe forecasted transaction occurs. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are\\nincluded in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. Beginning in the second quarter of 2014, 3M began\\nextending the maximum length of time over which it hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions\\nfrom a previous term of 12 months to a longer term of 24 months, with certain currencies being extended further to 36 months starting in the\\nfirst quarter of 2015.\\n \\nCash Flow Hedging - Commodity Price Management: The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,\\nprice protection agreements and commodity price swaps. 3M discontinued the use of commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of\\nforecasted commodity transactions in the first quarter of 2015. The Company used commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted\\ncommodity transactions to manage price volatility. The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other\\ncomprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected\\nearnings.\\n \\n100', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 100, 'end_page': 101}),\n",

The termination resulted in an $8 million pretax ($5 million after-tax) loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the twelve-year life of the notes.\\n \\nIn the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 2016 with an\\naggregate notional amount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.\\nUpon issuance of medium-term notes in September 2016, 3M terminated these interest rate swaps. The termination resulted in an immaterial\\nloss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\\n \\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $200 million as a\\nhedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.\\n \\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss)\\nrecognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had a balance of $91 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash\\nflow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $6 million (after tax\\nloss) related to forward starting interest rate swaps, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates\\nas of December 31, 2016, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $57 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow\\nhedging gains to earnings in 2017, approximately $26 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to\\nearnings in 2018, and approximately $8 million of the after-tax net unrealized foreign exchange cash flow hedging gains to earnings after\\n2018 (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\\n \\nThe location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative\\ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table.

To help\\nmanage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at\\nspecified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal\\namount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of\\nthe underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. These fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no\\nimpact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.\\n \\nIn July 2007, in connection with the issuance of a seven-year Eurobond for an amount of 750 million Euros, the Company completed a\\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate\\nEurobond obligation. In August 2010, the Company terminated 150 million Euros of the notional amount of this swap. As a result, a gain of\\n18 million Euros, recorded as part of the balance of the underlying debt, was amortized as an offset to interest expense over this debt’s\\nremaining life. Prior to termination of the applicable portion of the interest rate swap, the mark-to-market of the hedge instrument was\\nrecorded as gains or losses in interest expense and was offset by the gain or loss on carrying value of the underlying debt instrument.\\nConsequently, the subsequent amortization of the 18 million Euros recorded as part of the underlying debt balance was not part of gains on\\nhedged items recognized in income in the tables below. The remaining interest rate swap of 250 million Euros (notional amount) matured in\\nJuly 2014.\\n \\nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million Euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixedto-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million Euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond\\nobligation.\\n \\nIn June 2014, 3M issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into an\\ninterest rate swap to convert $600 million of a $625 million note included in this issuance to an interest rate based on a floating three-month\\nLIBOR index as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.\\n \\nIn August 2015, 3M issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into\\ntwo interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation.

For instruments that are\\ndesignated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or\\nlosses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The\\nremainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in\\ncumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged\\nforeign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is dedesignated from a net investment hedge\\nrelationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings\\nthrough their maturity date.\\n \\n3M’s use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by\\ntime period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are dedesignated, matured, or\\nare newly issued and designated.

These estimates include transaction gains and\\nlosses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\\n \\n NOTE 13. Fair Value Measurements\\n \\n3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\\nrecurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to\\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard\\nalso establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants\\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.\\nUnobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset\\nor liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level\\n1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other\\nthan quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the\\nasset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\\nmeasurement.\\n \\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\\n \\nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities,\\navailable-for-sale investments (included as part of investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet) and certain derivative instruments.\\nDerivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at\\nfair value.\\n \\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities — except certain U.S. municipal securities:\\n \\nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for\\nthese securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from\\nlarge financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm\\nto determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding\\ncertain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 9.\\n \\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities —certain U.S. municipal securities only:\\n \\nIn both 2016 and 2014, 3M obtained municipal bonds with the City of Nevada, Missouri, which represent 3M’s only U.S. municipal\\nsecurities holding as of December 31, 2016. Due to the nature of this security, the valuation method utilized will include the financial health\\nof the City of Nevada, any recent municipal bond issuances by Nevada, and macroeconomic considerations related to the direction of\\ninterest rates and the health of the overall municipal bond market, and as such will be classified as a level 3 security.\\n \\nAvailable-for-sale investments:\\n \\nInvestments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. Closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and\\nare used as being representative of fair value. 3M classifies these securities as level 1.\\n \\nDerivative instruments:\\n \\nThe Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair\\nvalue. The Company’s derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price\\nswaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use\\nforeign currency denominated debt to hedge 3M’s net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820,\\nas the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with\\nrespect to other factors that may impact fair value.\\n \\n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, commodity price swaps, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps\\nand cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the\\nasset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using\\nstandard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary\\nsource for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated\\nthrough third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\\n \\n108', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 108, 'end_page': 109}),\n",

The Company estimates its total unconditional purchase obligation commitment\\n(for those contracts with terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2016, at $608 million. Payments by year are estimated as follows:\\n2017 ($193 million), 2018 ($189 million), 2019 ($123 million), 2020 ($54 million), 2021 ($24 million) and after 2021 ($25 million). Many\\nof these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are\\nsold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. The\\npurchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the\\nCompany is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional\\ncommitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide an indication of the Company’s expected future cash outflows related to\\npurchase obligations.\\n \\nWarranties/Guarantees:\\n \\n3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are\\nestimated at approximately $47 million at December 31, 2016, and $28 million at December 31, 2015. 3M does not consider this amount to\\nbe material.

Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all\\nsuch litigation.\\n \\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\\n \\nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and\\nare otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about\\nfuture events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies,\\nand related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss\\nand where liability is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records the most likely estimate\\nof the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range\\nof loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant\\nlegal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there\\nis at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\\n \\nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law\\ninterpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and\\nrecords an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. For those insured matters where the Company has taken an accrual, the\\nCompany also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the Company’s insurance program. For those\\ninsured matters where the Company has not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not\\nestimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of\\ninsurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.\\n \\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that\\nthe Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable\\ndevelopment could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in\\nthe period in which they are recorded. Although the Company cannot estimate its exposure to all legal proceedings, it currently believes that\\nsuch future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. Based on\\nexperience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each\\nperiod, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the\\nCompany makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the\\nCompany’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the\\nCompany could change in the future.\\n \\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities\\nand associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\\n \\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that\\npurport to represent approximately 2,660 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,130 individual claimants with actions pending\\nat December 31, 2015.\\n \\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s\\nmask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace\\nexposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in\\nthe workplace.

The\\nCompany expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past.\\nAccordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater\\npercentage of total claims than in the past. The Company has prevailed in all eleven cases taken to trial, including nine of the ten cases tried\\nto verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2015, and 2016–described below), and an appellate reversal in 2005\\nof the 2001 jury verdict adverse to the Company. The remaining case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff’s\\nevidence, based on the court’s legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict. In August 2016,\\n3M received a unanimous defense verdict from a jury in state court in Kentucky, in 3M’s first respirator trial involving coal mine dust. The\\nestate of the plaintiff alleged that the 3M 8710 respirator is defective and caused his death because it did not protect him from harmful coal\\nmine dust. The jury rejected plaintiff’s claim and returned a verdict finding no liability against 3M. The verdict is final as the plaintiff did\\nnot file an appeal.\\n \\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in\\nthe intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their\\nmedical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s\\nlitigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons,\\nand it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.\\n \\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two\\nother manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in\\n2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly\\nincurred by the State for worker’s compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and\\nunspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management\\nconference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages\\nproceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for this matter because\\nthe Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible\\nloss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in\\nthis case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant’s share of liability may turn on\\nthe law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried.\\n \\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables:\\n \\nThe Company annually conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities in connection with finalizing and\\nreporting its annual results of operations, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review. The Company\\nreviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the\\nnature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Company’s mask or respirator products and alleging\\nexposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly\\nmanufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and\\nresolve claims, (collectively, the “Claims Data”). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company provides the Claims Data to a\\nthird party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in\\nestimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of\\nprobable liability.\\n \\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Company’s estimate of its liabilities.

In 2016, the Company made payments for legal fees and settlements of $62 million related to the\\nrespirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities\\n(excluding Aearo accruals) of $595 million and $588 million, respectively. This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of probable\\nloss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. Refer to Note 1\\nfor further detail on the revision of this accrual. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which\\nthe liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims\\nthat have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims\\nagainst multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendant’s share of\\nliability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the\\nCompany considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect\\nthe Company’s estimate of liabilities.\\n \\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company’s receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4\\nmillion. As a result of a final arbitration decision in June 2016 regarding insurance coverage under two policies, 3M reversed its receivable\\nfor the insurance recoveries related to respirator mask/asbestos litigation by $35 million.

Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and\\njudgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner\\nLambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each\\ncompany sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation\\nand the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement\\nentered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of\\n$100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to\\nasbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular\\nrespirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the\\nalleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in\\nplace, Aearo’s potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos,\\nsilica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997.

Following additional discovery, the parties filed new motions for summary\\njudgment. In February 2016, the court ruled in favor of Aearo on these two remaining issues, and ordered that Cabot, and not Aearo, is\\nsolely responsible for all liability for the coal mine dust lawsuits under the 1995 agreement.

As a result of its phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl\\ncompounds. The company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the\\nphase-out announcement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. Through its\\nongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Company’s policies covering\\nthe use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to control or eliminate the presence of certain PFCs in\\npurchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M’s fluorochemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\\n \\nRegulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international\\nbodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. In\\nOctober 2016, the European Commission notified the World Trade Organization of a draft regulation to restrict PFOA and its related\\nsubstances under the EU’s REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals). If adopted, the\\nregulation would restrict PFOA and its related substances to concentrations no greater than 25 parts per billion in constituents of other\\nsubstances, in mixtures, and in articles. As the database of studies of both chemicals has expanded, the EPA has developed human health\\neffects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In February 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft\\nhuman health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in August 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced\\nlifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (superseding the provisional levels established by the EPA in\\n2009 of 400 parts per trillion for PFOA and 200 parts per trillion for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA recommends\\nthat the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also 70 parts per trillion.\\nLifetime health advisories, while not enforceable, serve as guidance and are benchmarks for determining if concentrations of chemicals in\\ntap water from public utilities are safe for public consumption. In an effort to collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water\\nAct, the EPA published on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFCs, required to be monitored during the period\\n2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. Through July 2016, the EPA reported results for\\n4,909 public water supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and\\n46 exceed the level for PFOS. A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples\\nstated that 65 public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples\\ncollected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does\\nnot identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public water supplies.\\n \\nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFCcontaining waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois\\nplants.\\n \\nAs previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental\\nManagement (ADEM) to address the presence of PFCs in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to\\na permit issued by ADEM, for approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing\\nPFCs in fields at its Decatur facility.

The district court, however, denied 3M’s motion to disqualify Covington because it further found that 3M impliedly\\nwaived by delaying to assert the conflict. Other activity in the case, which had been stayed pending the outcome of the disqualification issue,\\nhas resumed. A trial date has not yet been set.

TransWeb filed a declaratory judgment action in and successfully moved the\\nlitigation to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking a declaration of invalidity and non-infringement of 3M’s patents,\\nand further alleging that 3M waited too long to enforce its rights. TransWeb also alleged 3M obtained the patents through inequitable\\nconduct and that 3M’s attempt to enforce the patents constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. In November 2012, a jury returned a\\nverdict in favor of TransWeb on all but one count, including findings that 3M’s patents were invalid and not infringed, and that 3M had\\ncommitted an antitrust violation by seeking to enforce a patent it had obtained fraudulently. The jury also recommended that the court find\\n3M had committed inequitable conduct in obtaining the patents, and that the patents were therefore unenforceable. Since the vast majority of\\nTransWeb’s claim for treble antitrust damages was in the form of its attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with the defense of the\\npatent case, the parties agreed that the measure of damages would not go to the jury, but rather would be submitted to a special master after\\nthe trial. In April, 2014, the court issued an order denying 3M’s motions to set aside the jury’s verdict. In addition, the court found two 3M\\npatents unenforceable due to inequitable conduct. The court accepted the special master’s recommendation as to the amount of attorneys’\\nfees to be awarded as damages, and entered judgment against 3M.

Stock-Based Compensation\\n \\nThe 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) provides for the issuance or delivery of up to 100 million shares of 3M common stock\\n(including additional shareholder approvals subsequent to 2008) pursuant to awards granted under the plan. In May 2016, shareholders\\napproved the 2016 LTIP, providing an additional 23,965,000 shares, increasing the number of approved shares to 123,965,000 shares. The\\n2016 LTIP succeeds the 3M 2008 LTIP. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,\\nprogressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and\\nperformance shares. Awards denominated in shares of common stock other than options and stock appreciation rights, count against the\\n123,965,000 share limit as 3.38 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates prior to May 11,\\n2010), as 2.87 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates on or after May 11, 2010, and prior\\nto May 8, 2012), as 3.50 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of May 8, 2012 and prior\\nto May 10, 2016), or as 2.50 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of May 10, 2016 or\\nlater). The remaining total shares available for grant under the LTIP Program are 36,865,814 as of December 31, 2016. There were\\napproximately 7,600 participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units at December 31, 2016.\\n \\nThe Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the\\nperformance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees\\nuses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period\\napproach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at\\nage 55 and after having completed ten years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the 2016 annual stock-based\\ncompensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.\\n \\nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.\\nThe Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the\\nissuance of common stock and are considered immaterial for disclosure purposes by the Company.\\n \\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\\nThe adoption is required to be implemented prospectively and resulted in income tax benefits of $184 million for 2016. See Note 1 for\\nadditional information regarding ASU No. 2016-09.\\n \\nAmounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted\\nstock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following\\ntable.

This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 22\\nmonths. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $149 million, $166\\nmillion and $145 million, respectively. The Company’s actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted\\nstock and restricted stock units for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $56 million, $62 million and $54 million, respectively.\\n \\nRestricted stock units granted generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents\\nequal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting\\nperiod, although no dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends\\nare paid out in cash at the vest date on restricted stock units, except for performance shares which do not earn dividends. Since the rights to\\ndividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average restricted stock unit shares\\noutstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\\n \\nPerformance Shares\\n \\nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The\\n2016 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and\\nearnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The\\nnumber of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere\\nfrom 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. Nonsubstantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each\\nindividual became a 3M executive. Prior to the 2016 performance share grant, performance shares did not accrue dividends during the\\nperformance period. Therefore, the grant date fair value was determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net\\npresent value of dividends during the performance period. The 2016 performance share grant accrues dividends, therefore the grant date fair\\nvalue is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings\\nper share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted\\nearnings per share.\\n \\n125', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 125, 'end_page': 126}),\n",

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial\\nreporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).

Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, the\\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\\nDecember 31, 2016 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their\\nreport which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2016.\\n \\nc.

The Plan does this by supplementing the before‑tax deferral provisions of the\\n3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (VIP), which are limited by the requirements\\nof the Internal Revenue Code.\\n \\nThe provisions of the Plan were originally effective as of January 1, 2002. The Plan was amended effective\\nJanuary 1, 2009. The purposes of the amendment were to (a) bring the plan document into compliance with the\\nrequirements of section 409A of the Code, including the regulations issued thereunder, and (b) close the Plan to\\nnew contributions effective upon the receipt of all contributions made pursuant to elections with respect to the\\n2008 Plan Year. From October 3, 2004 (the date section 409A was added to the Code) through December 31,\\n2008, the Plan was operated in good faith compliance with the requirements of section 409A including the special\\ntransition rules issued by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with\\nthe implementation of section 409A. For avoidance of doubt, the amendment was intended to apply both to\\ndeferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., deferred compensation credited under the Plan\\nwhich related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1, 2005), as well as deferred compensation\\ncredited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or before December 31, 2004 that is\\neligible to be “grandfathered” from application of section 409A of the Code.\\n \\nThe Plan is hereby amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2016.\\n \\nARTICLE 1\\n \\nDEFINITIONS\\n \\nFor the purposes of this Plan, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated, unless the\\ncontext clearly indicates otherwise:\\n \\n1.1.

This Nonqualified Plan I is intended to supplement the ERIP originally adopted by 3M\\nin 1931 and as amended from time to time thereafter.\\nHistory: 3M originally adopted a nonqualified pension plan on November 7, 1978. This original plan was\\nnamed the Supplemental Pension Plan of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (hereinafter the\\n“Supplemental Plan”). The Supplemental Plan was amended from time to time after its adoption. Effective\\nJanuary 1, 1993, the Supplemental Plan was amended and restated as two separate plans: the “Nonqualified\\nPension Plan I of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company” and “Nonqualified Pension Plan II of\\nMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company”. The provisions of the restatements superseded all prior\\nversions of the Supplemental Plan. Such restatements have been amended from time to time since their\\nadoption. Nonqualified Plan I provides supplemental benefits that are strictly in excess of section 415 of the\\nCode. Nonqualified Plan II provided certain additional supplemental retirement benefits, but effective January 1,\\n2009, such plan has been amended to provide supplemental retirement benefits that are strictly in excess of\\nlimitations under section 401(a)(17) and 402(g) of the Code.\\nEffective January 1, 2009, this Nonqualified Plan I was again amended and restated (the “2009\\nRestatement”). The provisions of this restatement supersede all prior versions of the Plan. The purpose of this\\nrestatement is to bring the Plan into compliance with section 409A of the Code by “de-linking” the payment\\nprovisions under this Plan from the payment provisions under the ERIP. From October 3, 2004 (the date\\nsection 409A was added to the Code) through December 31, 2008, the Plan continued to operate with “linked”\\npayment provisions in accordance with special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of\\nTreasury in connection with the implementation of section 409A of the Code. For avoidance of doubt, this\\nrestatement is intended to apply both to deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., deferred\\ncompensation credited under the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1,\\n2005), as well as deferred compensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or\\nbefore December 31, 2004 that is eligible to be “grandfathered” from application of section 409A of the\\nCode. However, the benefits payable to Members and Former Members (and their Beneficiaries) who\\ncommenced payment of their Nonqualified Plan I Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 will be determined in\\naccordance with the provisions of the Plan in effect at the time of their benefit commencement and will not be\\nadjusted or recomputed to reflect this or any subsequent amendment or restatement of this Nonqualified Plan I.\\nEffect: This Nonqualified Plan I is hereby amended and restated effective January 1, 2016. Similar to the 2009\\nRestatement, the benefits payable to Members and Former Members (and their\\n \\n \\n-1-', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 170, 'end_page': 171}),\n",

This Nonqualified Plan II\\nis not intended to duplicate the retirement benefits provided under the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plan I.\\n \\nHistory: 3M originally adopted a nonqualified pension plan on November 7, 1978. This original plan was\\nnamed the Supplemental Pension Plan of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (hereinafter the\\n“Supplemental Plan”). The Supplemental Plan was amended from time to time after its adoption. Effective\\nJanuary 1, 1993, the Supplemental Plan was amended and restated as two separate plans: the “Nonqualified\\nPension Plan I of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company” and “Nonqualified Pension Plan II of\\nMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company”. The provisions of the restatements superseded all prior\\nversions of the Supplemental Plan. Such restatements have been amended from time to time since their\\nadoption. Nonqualified Plan I provides supplemental benefits that are strictly in excess of section 415 of the\\nCode. Nonqualified Plan II provided certain additional supplemental retirement benefits, but effective January 1,\\n2009, such plan was amended to provide supplemental retirement benefits that are strictly in excess of limitations\\nunder section 401(a)(17) and 402(g) of the Code.\\n \\nEffective January 1, 2009, this Nonqualified Plan II was again amended and restated (the “2009\\nRestatement”). The provisions of the 2009 Restatement superseded all prior versions of the Plan. The purpose of\\nthe 2009 Restatement was twofold: (1) to limit the supplemental retirement benefits hereunder to benefits that\\nare strictly in excess of the limitations under section 401(a)(17) and section 402(g) of the Code, and (2) to bring\\nthe Plan into compliance with section 409A of the Code by “de-linking” the payment provisions under this Plan\\nfrom the payment provisions under the ERIP. From October 3, 2004 (the date section 409A was added to the\\nCode) through December 31, 2008, the Plan continued to operate with “linked” payment provisions in accordance\\nwith special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with the\\nimplementation of section 409A of the Code. For avoidance of doubt, the 2009 Restatement was intended to\\napply both to deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., deferred compensation credited\\nunder the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1, 2005), as well as deferred\\ncompensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or before December 31,\\n2004 that is eligible to be “grandfathered” from application of section 409A of the Code. However, the benefits\\npayable to Members and Former Members (and their Beneficiaries) who commenced payment of their\\nNonqualified Plan II Benefit prior to January 1, 2009 will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the\\nPlan in effect at the time of their benefit commencement and will not be adjusted or recomputed to reflect this or\\nany subsequent amendment or restatement of this Nonqualified Plan II.\\n \\n \\n-1-', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 187, 'end_page': 188}),\n",

The Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to decide whether some or all of the lump sum\\namounts will be paid directly to the respective Members, Former Members and Beneficiaries, or will be applied\\ntoward fully paid annuity contracts issued by an A+ rated insurance company, which provide for the payment of\\nall the amounts that would otherwise have been paid after the Change in Control pursuant to this Nonqualified\\nPlan II.\\n \\n7.2 . Definition of Change in Control. For purposes of this Article 7, a Change in Control of 3M shall be\\ndeemed to have occurred if there is a “change in the ownership of 3M,” “change in effective control of 3M,”\\nand/or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of 3M’s assets” as defined under Treasury reg.\\nsection 1.409A-3(i)(5) or such other regulation or guidance issued under section 409A of the Code.\\n \\n7 . 3 . Determination of Present Value. Except where otherwise expressly provided in this Nonqualified\\nPlan II, the present value of each Member’s, each Former Member’s and each Beneficiary’s remaining accrued\\nretirement benefits hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such actuarial assumptions as the\\nCompensation Committee, in its discretion, may adopt for such purpose.\\n \\n7.4. Fees and Expenses. 3M shall pay to each Member, Former Member and Beneficiary the amount of all\\nreasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses incurred by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary in\\nseeking to obtain or enforce his or her rights under this Article 7, unless a lawsuit commenced by the Member,\\nFormer Member or Beneficiary for such purposes is dismissed by the court as being spurious or frivolous. 3M\\nshall also pay to each Member, Former Member and Beneficiary the amount of all reasonable tax and financial\\nplanning fees and expenses incurred by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary in connection with the\\nreceipt by such Member, Former Member or Beneficiary of payments pursuant to this Article 7. Such payment or\\nreimbursement shall be made no later than the end of the recipient’s taxable year following the taxable year in\\nwhich the recipient incurs the related expenses.

This Nonqualified Plan III is intended to supplement the ERIP originally adopted by 3M in 1931 and\\nas amended from time to time thereafter. This Nonqualified Plan III is not intended to duplicate the retirement\\nbenefits provided under the 3M Nonqualified Pension Plans I and II, both of which provide retirement benefits\\nthat are strictly in excess of limitations under section 401(a)(17), 402(g) and 415 of the Code.\\nHistory: 3M originally adopted a nonqualified pension plan on November 7, 1978. This original plan was\\nnamed the Supplemental Pension Plan of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (hereinafter the\\n“Supplemental Plan”). The Supplemental Plan was amended from time to time after its adoption. Effective\\nJanuary 1, 1993, the Supplemental Plan was amended and restated as two separate plans: the “Nonqualified\\nPension Plan I of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company” and “Nonqualified Pension Plan II of\\nMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company”. The provisions of the restatements superseded all prior\\nversions of the Supplemental Plan. Such restatements have been amended from time to time since their\\nadoption. Nonqualified Plan I provides supplemental benefits that are strictly in excess of section 415 of the\\nCode. Nonqualified Plan II provided certain additional supplemental retirement benefits, but effective January 1,\\n2009, such plan has been amended to provide supplemental retirement benefits that are strictly in excess of\\nlimitations under section 401(a)(17) and 402(g) of the Code.\\nEffective January 1, 2009, this Nonqualified Plan III was established to provide retirement benefits that\\nsupplement the ERIP but which are not strictly in excess of limitations under section 401(a)(17), 402(g) and 415\\nof the Code. Any and all deferred compensation obligations accrued under Nonqualified Plan II prior to\\nJanuary 1, 2009 which were not strictly in excess of limitations under sections 401(a)(17), 402(g) and 415 of the\\nCode became part of and governed under the terms of this Nonqualified Plan III. The purpose of the creation of\\nthis Plan was twofold: (1) to provide for supplemental retirement benefits hereunder that are not strictly in excess\\nof the limitations under section 401(a)(17) and section 402(g) of the Code, and (2) to bring the benefits\\ntransferred to this Plan into compliance with section 409A of the Code by “de-linking” the payment provisions\\nunder this Plan from the payment provisions under the ERIP. From October 3, 2004 (the date section 409A was\\nadded to the Code) through December 31, 2008, the prior Nonqualified Plan II operated with “linked” payment\\nprovisions in accordance with special transition rules issued by the IRS and the U.S. Department of Treasury in\\nconnection with the implementation of section 409A of the Code. For avoidance of doubt, this Nonqualified Plan\\nIII was intended to apply both to deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., deferred\\ncompensation credited under the Plan which related all or in part to services performed on or after January 1,\\n2005), as well as deferred compensation credited under the Plan which relates entirely to services performed on or\\nbefore December 31, 2004 that is eligible to be\\n-1-', meta={'company': '3M', 'report_date': '2026-12-31', 'doc_type': 'earnings_report', 'source_path': '/home/isztld/hackaton/hackingsocks_david/00_dataset/financebench/pdfs/3M_2016_10K.pdf', 'md5': 'c1a369b900ee48b0cb1ee69efef7e15d', 'start_page': 205, 'end_page': 206}),\n",
