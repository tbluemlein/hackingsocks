Maersk, viewed as a barometer of world trade, said it now expected global container volumes to increase by 2% to 4% this year, compared with a range of down 1% to up 4% estimated in May. The new range implies lower second-half growth, it said.  A drop in U.S. imports after President Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of tariffs on foreign goods ""was more than offset"" by strong growth in imports into other regions, including Europe, the Danish firm said in its second-quarter earnings statement.","Thu, 07 Aug 2025 06:12:41 +0000",NKE_2025-08-07,0.8176,0.2263
