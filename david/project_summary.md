# Summary
AI-driven finance decision-support and alerting system. It fuses market, macro, fundamental, and alternative data to output a single Risk Number (−100 no risk … +100 high risk), a 3‑month forecast, and clear Buy/Hold/Sell guidance. When anomalies appear, the system switches to warning mode and explains the trigger. 

# Key Features 

- Unified Risk Number with factor attribution
- 3‑month price/return forecasting with confidence bands
- Automated anomaly detection and real-time alerts
- KPI panel (ROE, Profit Margins, Debt‑to‑Equity, Free Cash Flow)
- Traceable decisions (drivers, rationale, and explainability)
     

# Data Inputs 

- Market/Technicals: prices, trends, momentum, volatility, chart features
- Positioning/Flow: COT data, whale/shark movement
- Fundamentals: earnings/revenue, cash flow, balance sheet
- Macroeconomics: central bank releases, economic calendar, exchange rates (e.g., ECB)
- Alternative/Sentiment: news/RSS, social media, Google Trends, analyst reports, political monitoring
- Example APIs: AlphaVantage, Myfxbook, Yahoo/Quandl-like feeds (normalized for time, currency, and symbols)
     
# Core KPIs 

- ROE: profitability of equity
- Profit Margins: pricing power and cost control
- Debt‑to‑Equity: leverage and risk
- Free Cash Flow: capacity to reinvest/return capital
     

# System Workflow 

1. Understand request (asset, horizon, risk profile)
2. Fetch data
2.1 getFinancialData (prices, fundamentals, COT)
2.2 getEconomicalData (macro, central banks, calendars)
2.3 getNewsAndTrends (news, social, trends)
3. Feature extraction (technicals, macro surprises, text features)  
4. Sentiment analysis (finance-tuned NLP)  
5. Evaluate data → compute KPIs and risk components  
6. Anomaly gateway  
6.1 Yes → Warning with drivers (what/why)  
6.2 No → Forecast and decision engine
7. Deliver outputs via dashboard/API/alerts
     

# Models 

- Outlier/Anomaly Detection: robust z-scores, Isolation Forest, or forecast-residual checks
- 3‑Month Forecast: ensemble (e.g., Prophet/XGBoost/LSTM) using technical, macro, positioning, sentiment, and KPI features
- Decision Engine: blends expected return, drawdown risk, KPI trend, sentiment, and macro regime to produce Buy/Hold/Sell and sizing/hedge suggestions
     

# Risk Number (−100 … +100) 

Built from weighted factor groups scored on −1 … +1:
- Difficult: news flow, social sentiment, environmental/geopolitical shocks
- Medium: trading network/COT, local politics, economic calendar
- Small: innovations/inventions, analyst revisions
         
Guidance bands:
- ≤ −40 favorable
- −40 … +20 normal
- +20 … +60 elevated
- ≥ +60 high risk (warnings dominate)

# Outputs 

- Risk Number with factor attribution
- 3‑month forecast range and confidence
- Action: Buy/Hold/Sell with rationale and optional hedge/sizing
- KPI panel with recent trajectory
- Real-time anomaly alerts plus daily/weekly summaries

# Roadmap 

Additional connectors (alt data), regime-aware model weighting, richer explainability (SHAP), portfolio-level risk aggregation, and backtest dashboards.
