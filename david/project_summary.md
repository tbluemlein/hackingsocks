FinDocGPT is an AI finance co‑pilot that turns messy market, macro, fundamental, and alternative data into one actionable signal. For any asset, it delivers a Risk Number (−100 no risk … +100 high risk), a 3‑month forecast, and a Buy/Hold/Sell decision with clear rationale. When conditions shift unexpectedly, it prioritizes safety: anomaly detection overrides forecasting and issues a targeted warning explaining what changed and why. 

Data coverage is broad and modular: prices/technicals, positioning (COT, “whale” flow), company fundamentals (earnings, cash flow), macro releases and central‑bank communications, exchange rates, and alternative sources like news, social media, Google Trends, analyst and political signals. Connectors (e.g., AlphaVantage, Myfxbook, ECB feeds) normalize symbols, time, and currencies and pass strict validation. 

The pipeline: understand the user request; ingest data; extract features (momentum, volatility, macro surprises, text embeddings); run sentiment analysis; compute KPIs (ROE, Profit Margins, Debt‑to‑Equity, Free Cash Flow); evaluate signals; pass an anomaly gateway. If no anomaly, an ensemble (Prophet/XGBoost/LSTM) forecasts the 3‑month path; a decision engine blends expected return, drawdown risk, KPI trends, sentiment, and macro regime to propose an action and sizing/hedges. 

The Risk Number is built from a weighted factor tree: difficult (news/social/geopolitics/environmental), medium (COT/trading network, local politics, economic calendar), and small (innovation, analyst moves). Each group is normalized (−1…+1) and mapped to −100…+100 with guidance bands: ≤ −40 favorable, −40…+20 normal, +20…+60 elevated, ≥ +60 high risk. 

Outputs include the Risk Number with attribution, forecast range and confidence, recommended action, KPI trends, and real‑time alerts via dashboard or API. Quality is enforced through schema checks, caching, backtests, regime‑aware weighting, and explainability (feature importance/SHAP). The architecture is plug‑and‑play, enabling rapid addition of new data sources, models, and portfolio‑level analytics.
